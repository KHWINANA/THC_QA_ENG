Please Note:

Please include a text document outlining your results/methods/approach/questions for each section below as a reference for us to review and discuss
Use Bitbucket, Github or Gitlab to commit your work and share the relating repo(s) with traverse.king@testheroes.co.za
Be prepared to demo your solution(s) in the on-site interview and walk us through it
The expectation is that the solution must meet software engineering best practices
For queries on the questions, please email : traverse.king@testheroes.co.za


Section 1 (20 points)

Using a script/command line tool/website to fetch the SSL certificate details of the website https://www.ultimateqa.com and identify when the certificate expires. Outline how you decided to go about this, and how you might automate this procedure so it would not need to be run manually. This can be as simple or more complicated as you like.

Section 2 (70 points)

Using a test framework of your choice (e.g. Protractor, TestNG), create an automated end to end test suite that tests the following test cases:

Browse to https://www.ultimateqa.com/automation/ HYPERLINK "http://www.ultimateqa.com/automation/" and verify page Title.
Take a screenshot of the page
Maximize the browser window
Log in to the page via "Login automation" link - if you are presented with a captcha you are welcome to find a way to solve this either using a third-party tool or your own method
Logout from page
Browse to "Fill out forms" page and complete all forms, followed by submit action
Browse to the "Fake Pricing Page" and Purchase the Basic package

Your solution should include the following:

A test plan (this can be a simple text document)
The automation should make use of at least one mainstream programming language
e.g. Python, Typescript, Java etc.
The automation must generate a report indicating the success/failure status of each test created
The automation must cover Firefox and Chrome browsers
There must be clear instructions on how to execute the test suite on Windows, Linux and/or MacOS
A screen/video recording displaying the automation execution.

Follow up questions - please answer these in your text document:

How could you reduce the time to execute some or all of these test cases or if you had several sites to test?
Briefly (a few sentences is fine) describe how you would set up a pipeline on your preferred source control management platform to perform continuous integration testing of a simple front end web-based application. It could be anything you like eg a calculator that outputs the correct results from numbers you input..
Describe briefly how you would run performance testing against a web-based application.
Describe briefly what kind of security testing you might perform against a web-based application.
Describe how you might build in exception and error handling to your application.
